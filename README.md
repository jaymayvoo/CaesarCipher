Caesar Cipher

This program, written in C, performs a caesar cipher. It takes in either one or two command line arguments and outputs the encrypted message.

Option 1: Taking in 1 command line argument (integer)
This will output the alphabet, both lower case and upper case, along with the respected alphabet's shift.

Option 2: Taking in 2 command line argument (integer, string)
This will output the original message, and then the encrypted message following it. 

Entering any other number of arugments or the incorrect arugment types will result in an error (an error message will appear and the program will end).
